# inventorySystem
Basic inventory system highlighting the use of a JavaFX GUI

Compiled in Netbeans 8.2 with corresponding versions of JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
Allows user to enter new "parts" with various characteristics (price, current inventory levels, etc.) and "products"
that have characteristics (price, current inventory levels, etc.) and are composed of "parts."

Parts and products may be added, modified, and/or deleted. There is basic exception handling where some actions will 
display a warning. There is not much exception handling--just enough to show it in action. This is due to the
major point of the project which was to construct a professional and functioning GUI using JavaFX.

SceneBuilder was used to build the graphical aspect of the GUI. The source code is divided into "controller" 
classes for each screen of the GUI and the source files that control the backend functions.
